DevOps teaches us how to autoamte tasks, deploy quickly, collaborate better, and find and fix bugs better. Witout DevOps, a developer writes code, 
emails to the operations team, and waits a long time before it's deployed. This gap is problematic because if something breaks, blame is passed back 
and forth.
