DevOps teaches us how to autoamte tasks, deploy quickly, collaborate better, and find and fix bugs better. Witout DevOps, a developer writes code, 
emails to the operations team, and waits a long time before it's deployed. This gap is problematic because if something breaks, blame is passed back 
and forth. With DevOps, the dev pushes code to GitHub -> automated tests are run -> if all pass, the code is deployed to production in minutes instead
of days. Both production teams and dev teams see the logs and can fix issues quickly
