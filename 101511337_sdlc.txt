SDLC

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process that defines the phases involved in building, deploying, and maintaining high-quality software.

It serves as a framework for planning, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software to ensure that the final product meets user requirements, customer expectations, and organizational standards while minimizing risks and costs.
