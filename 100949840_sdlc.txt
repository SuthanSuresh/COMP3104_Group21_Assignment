Why does DevOps matters?

DevOps matters to a computer programmer because it connects people and processes across each stage of the software development cycle. 
It includes the necessary steps: planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, and monitoring.
Learning DevOps teaches you to automate and standardize these stages. With continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), 
every change is built and tested automatically, which catches issues early and makes releases smaller and safer.
Additionally, DevOps incorporates cooperation and dependability into the cycle. In order for teams to react swiftly and continuously
improve, practices like infrastructure as code.
